the python app creates this file etc



pages_made = [
    {
        "file_name": "_cleaner",
        "full_name": "\\test\\_cleaner.html",
        "subdir": "test",
        "size": 9414,
        "lines": 905,
        "base": "905: s_4_page_make_cards.py"
    },
    {
        "file_name": "_html",
        "full_name": "\\test\\_html.html",
        "subdir": "test",
        "size": 9399,
        "lines": 905,
        "base": "905: s_4_page_make_cards.py"
    },
    {

    Stored with the HTML you get a link to the page and a referece to the creating code.
    Im also now string in tht HTMl headers some more source data, tracking errros on a multi-dimensional site is a big job withour helpers like this.
    This arose out of fustration with Hugo not managing sites clearly, no I'm managing a site with 6000 web pages and many more media MP3 and MP4 entries.

    This allows others to check pages easily, sorting and selection tools are possible, or export as a csv file?
